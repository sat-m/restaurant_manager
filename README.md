A tool for reservations



The topic is a restaurant management system

In general the restaurant owner manages a couple of tables and you need to support online reservation.
A table has the following properties: location (let it be free text) and number of sits

The main screen should display a list of tables and support filtering by size and by reservations for a given period.

Technology that you should use is Angular, NgRx and optionally Ionic. Please create web app using Angular 10 and use mock json data instead of actual api data.
All components should use changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush

It will be nice to have a reservation entry form as well. Reservation is just picking a table and time.
